## Cluster analysis in R
### Energy efficiency in the private rental sector in Greater London

Like many countries globally, the private rental sector in England contains some of the poorest quality and least energy efficient properties. In this exercise we will use cluster analysis (specifically a k-means clustering approach) to identify patterns in energy inefficiency in the private rental sector across Greater London. We will use new energy performance certificate (EPC) data that offers detailed information about the energy efficiency of properties.

The exercise is especially topical as the government in England is [currently consulting on a new minimum energy efficiency standards](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/28/delays-landlord-energy-efficiency-standards-england-renters-tenants) for the private rental sector. Currently, private rentals must have a rating of E, however, there are ongoing consultations about increasing the rating to C from 2025

The tutorial builds on an established tradition of [geodemographic research in geography](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00330124.2013.848764). Here, k-means clustering is applied to identify clusters of data points with similar attributes. The technique is widely applied to understand  [COVID-19](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24694452.2021.1939647), [digital infrastructure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971519307963), [cities](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01640-8), [ecology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479721016029), and [poverty](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988320304035).
